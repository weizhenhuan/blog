Just a technical man who loves freedom and travel.

The main contents of this blog is mostly about **Artificial Intelligence(AI)** and **Deep Learning(DL)**, especially for **High-Performance Computing(HPC)** and **Inference Engine**.

I also like to post about my life...beautiful scenery during the journey, some pleasant or terrible moments and whatever else I seem to be obsessing over that month.

Hope you enjoy what you're reading here!  Feel free to drop me an <a href="mailto:zhenhuan2002@163.com">email</a> if you want to have a contact with me.
